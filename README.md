# Molecular solubility prediction with machine learning

#### This repository contains my first data science project, where I predict molecular solubility using machine learning techniques. The project demonstrates the integration of domain knowledge in chemistry with data science workflows, employing advanced predictive models to solve a real-world problem.


## Project overview

#### Predicting molecular solubility is crucial in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries, as solubility impacts drug delivery, formulation, and efficacy. This project leverages machine learning to predict solubility based on molecular descriptors, providing an efficient, data-driven solution.


## Features 

### Model development:
#### Using models such as linear regressor and random forest

### Evaluating model performance:
#### - Using metrics like RÂ² and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess accuracy.
#### - Visualization of predictions versus actual values for model insights.

### Data visualisation:
#### Using a scatter plot to graphically represent the results.


## Technicalities

### Programming language:
#### Python

### Libraries used:
#### - Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn


## Components

#### - README file
- CSV data file
- Main code
